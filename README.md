# D&D 5e spellbook
Because you own the Player's Handbook, but flipping through it is a pain in the ass.

Loads the spell list from an external file and saves it in localstorage. Provides various filters.

## To do
* Filter by concentration
* Filter by ritual
* Filter by school
* Filter by name

### Maybe?
* Save to a personal (localstorage) spell book?
* Hide the filters in a hamburger menu?

## License
As with everything I code, this is licensed under JSON, which specifically states the software shall not be used for evil. In this case I need to clarify that this is evil in *the real world*, and lawful/neutral/chaotic evil *characters* are free to use it.

As always, I understand this makes it not "free software" and as always I do not care. Nazi punks fuck off.
